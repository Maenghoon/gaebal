<h2>https</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS(<strong> HyperText Transfer <u>Protocol</u> over Secure Socket Layer</strong>, HTTP over TLS, HTTP over SSL, HTTP Secure)</a>
<br>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.[4][5] In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that one is communicating with the intended website without interference from attackers.</p>
